#### About Me
---
I am passionate about deep learning and natural language processing. Currently, I am researching a generative AI model that predicts RNA, DNA, and protein structures from cryo-EM maps with over 95% improved accuracy compared to legacy tools. I have built a fully automated self-training pipeline that simulates synthetic datasets and retrains across parameter variations, reducing model loss by 50%. I also have experience building agentic SaaS platforms and visually engaging web games. Beyond software, I am contributing to the development of a self-driving Mars rover. I am honored to be a NASA scholarship recipient for academic excellence in STEM. My interests in AI research, software development, and robotics.
